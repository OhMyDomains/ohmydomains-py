= Oh My Domains: An API and CLI to simplify managing domain names for you.

When your domain names are scattered around registrars,
maintaining them becomes a pain.
Even remembering how many domain names you have and what they are
is no easy job.

`Oh My Domains` aims to help you: with one API you can
retrieve data of any and all domain names you have,
and update their contact and name server records with ease.

It will support more registrars and functionalities, gradually.
